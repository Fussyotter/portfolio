# The Lord of the Rings: The Two Powers

 Using the Two Powers (jQuery and VanillaJS) you will lead this incredible cast of characters through the Shire, into Rivendell, and eventually into the heart of Mordor itself... helping them to successfully traverse Middle Earth as you skillfully traverse the DOM

Pack up, because we're going on an adventure...

#### Learning Objectives

- Use both JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate the DOM
- Strengthen your understanding of both by utilizing the functionality of each

#### Prerequisites

- jQuery 
- JavaScript
- HTML / DOM

---

## Getting Started

1. For VanillaJS, you will be writing your answers inside of the `fellowship.js` file located in today's `homework/scripts/` folder

1. For jQuery, you will be writing your answers inside of the `fellowship_jquery.js` file - also located in the `/scripts` folder

1. When you are working with jQuery, comment out the VanillaJS <script> tag in the head of `index.html`. And vice versa when working with jQuery. 

1. While you're working, make sure to open the `index.html` file in your browser to test your work. It is located at: `homework/lotr/index.html`

## Resources 

1. Inside the folder `lotr` folder are an `index.html` file and a `style.css` sheet that will add some structure and style to your homework.
1. **You will be coding in the `fellowship.js` file.**
1. You will be doing a _tiny_ bit of work in the CSS file once you get to Chapter 9.
1. You **should not** touch the HTML file.

## Directions

1. Open the `fellowship.js` file in your text editor.
2. Observe the arrays of people and places and the 13 chapters that have been included.
3. Note that each chapter has a button in your browser with a click handler attached in the html file, and an associated javascript / jQuery function in app.js.
4. Your job is to **fill in the code inside the jQuery functions** to get the application working as intended.
5. Once you have jQuery complete, rename the file to `fellowship_jquery.js` and create a new `fellowship.js` file. This is where you'll place your VanillaJS code. 

:elephant: Remember that you can check your **DOM tree** in the **Elements tab** in the Chrome Console.

## Workflow

Tackle this homework **one function** at a time in order from start to finish.

1. When you begin, write a console.log inside of the function that you are working on to check that the event listener works when you click the associated button.

2. Write the correct DOM manipulatory code inside the function and check that it works.

NOTE: Each function depends on the previous ones, so make sure your function works before moving on to the next one!

3. Every time you **refresh** the browser, you will have to **click the buttons** one by one **in order from the beginning** to operate your application. (If really don't want the popups after you've completed a step, you can check to disable each popup and speed up the process of debugging).

## :spiral_notepad: Commit!

Commit your work after each function is **complete** and **working** *properly*

## Need Some Help?

If you need help remembering all of the jQuery DOM commands, check out the [jQuery cheatsheet](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Web-Development-Immersive-Remote/WDIR-Stan-Lee/wiki/jQuery-Cheatsheet).

If you need some help with jQuery vs VanillaJS, here's a [cheatsheet](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/move-from-jquery-to-vanilla-javascript/) for common commands in jQuery and in vanillaJS. 


## Did I Do It Right? 

Provided below are just some screenshots showing you what your `index.html` should look like for some of the early chapters so you can be sure you're on the right track!

## Deliverables

1. Your homework folder that will contain: all files and folders (including index.html etc) AND your:
 -`fellowship.js` file with all of your vanillaJS.  
 -`fellowship_jquery.js` file with all of your jQuery

## Technical Requirements

Both of your files (JavaScript and jQuery) MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment explaining: what is wrong, what steps you took to get it to work.


## Submission Guidelines

- Make it your goal to submit your homework before 10AM on Monday!
